# Aidan-Slovik-Individual-Repo

My individual project is a clicker game.
The player clicks on the main button, which gives them points. They can then spend the points on upgrades that make their clicks worth more or on upgrades that automatically add points. The goal will be either to get as many points as possible in a limited amount of time or to get a set amount of points as fast as possible.

## Download instructions:
1. Download the repository as a .zip file
2. Extract the file
3. Navigate to the game.pde file inside of src(you might have to move all src files to a new folder labeled Game)
4. Run the program

## To Do:
1. ✅ Add end goals such as speedrun mode and get points mode
2. ❌ Add a start screen with instructions on how to play
3. ❌ Add more buttons and implement the flow of the game
4. ❌ Add better graphics and implement the theme
5. ❌ Add a way to keep high scores

## Year two concepts:
1. abstract class(for my upgrade class which is not declared)
2. inheritance(for different upgrade classes)
3. enhanced for loops(to run through arrays and arraylists for readability)
4. I/O(for easier button and upgrade creation and eventual high score keeping)
5. GUI
